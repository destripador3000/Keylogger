This is a simple keylogger designed to demonstrate the different behaviors of a keylogger. We use an email service (SMTP) to send the captured keystrokes, which are stored in a text file.
To use this program, you need to specify the email and password for the email service. Please note that this file does not include any antivirus evasion techniques and was not created for illegal purposes.
